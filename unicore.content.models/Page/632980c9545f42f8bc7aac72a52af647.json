Here is how malaria affected Rwanda in 2012:\r\n\r\n - 100% of the population of Rwanda was living in an at-risk area where the malaria parasite was present.\r\n\r\n - It is estimated that 650,000 people caught the disease, and 3,800 died, just from a simple mosquito bite.\r\n\r\n - Malaria has cost Rwanda approximately 1,950,000 productive work days, which has a detrimental impact on the county\u2019s overall economy.\r\n\r\n**How you can help**\r\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way.  You can help protect your family, and your country, from malaria by taking a few simple steps:\r\n\r\n - Make sure your whole family sleeps under a bed net every night.\r\n\r\n - Seek testing, and then treatment, from a doctor or health worker at the first sign of illness.\r\n\r\n - If you are given treatment, make sure to finish your pills!\r\n\r\nTo learn more about malaria in your country, visit the Rwanda malaria program.",
